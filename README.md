# nStats-ZS
nStats is a statistics system for Zombie Survival. It uses NWInt and PData.

## Installation

Drag 'n drop **nStats-ZS** in your `garrysmod/addons` folder.

## Config(uration)

nStats comes with a config(uration) file. The file is located in `nStats-ZS/lua/autorun/nstatszs_config.lua`

Though the config(uration) file is currently small, it will have more options at some point in the future.

## Port for Old ZS versions

nStats comes with an option for old zs ports. Due to old zs versions not having newer version functions, some options are disabled when setting `nStatsZS.NoxZS = true` to false.

**If you know what you are doing, you have the option to port Nox ZS functions to Old ZS.**
